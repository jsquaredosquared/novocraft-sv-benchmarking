# Novocraft SV benchmarking

## About the project

This repository contains a Snakemake workflow used to compare the performance of SV callers using srWGS BAM files produced by different aligners. Currently it is being designed to compare SV calls by Manta on BAM files aligned by NovoAlign and BWA-MEM2, although it could be extended to compare other SV callers or aligners.

This work is part of my internship at Novocraft Technologies Sdn Bhd (July 2024 - September 2024).
